Test for proper shape notation

The application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes in a parent Shape class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
